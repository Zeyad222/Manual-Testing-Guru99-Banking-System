# Guru99 Banking System Manual Testing Project  

### Overview  
This project focuses on manual testing of the **Guru99 Banking System**, a demo banking application designed to practice and showcase software testing skills. The project involves the creation and execution of test cases to ensure the application meets functional requirements and works as expected across various scenarios.  

### Objectives  
The key objectives of this project are:  
- **Understanding Requirements**: Analyze the application's functionalities to derive test scenarios.  
- **Test Case Design**: Create comprehensive test cases covering functional, boundary, and negative testing scenarios.  
- **Defect Identification**: Identify and document bugs, inconsistencies, or issues during test execution.  
- **Testing Best Practices**: Apply manual testing methodologies to ensure thorough coverage and accurate results.  

### Scope of Testing  
The testing activities include:  
1. **Functional Testing**: Validate core functionalities such as login, customer creation, deposit, withdrawal, and fund transfer.  
2. **Boundary Testing**: Test input limits for fields like account numbers and transaction amounts.  
3. **Negative Testing**: Verify application behavior with invalid inputs and scenarios (e.g., incorrect credentials).  
4. **UI Testing**: Check the user interface for consistency, usability, and adherence to design standards.  

### Methodology  
- **Test Planning**: Identify test objectives, scope, and constraints based on application requirements.  
- **Test Case Development**: Create detailed test cases with clear preconditions, steps, and expected results.  
- **Test Execution**: Manually execute test cases and document actual outcomes.  
- **Defect Reporting**: Log and prioritize issues in a bug tracking tool or spreadsheet for resolution.  

### Tools & Artifacts  
- **Test Documentation**: Test Plan, Test Cases, and Defect Report.  
- **Testing Tools**: Excel/Google Sheets for managing test cases and reports.  


### Results & Insights  
- Documented successful and failed test cases with detailed observations.  
- Identified critical and non-critical defects, providing actionable feedback to improve the application's quality.  
- Demonstrated proficiency in manual testing techniques and best practices.
